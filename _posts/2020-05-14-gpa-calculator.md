Calculating how a certain grade will affect your GPA can be very useful. Most universities are already offering tools to do this but most of them are slow and hard to use. This [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1OqaatnKZ-zUgWHQqZqTMPoClL_gPgD0FBOpygNYVCmk/copy){:target="_blank"} <i class="fa fa-external-link" aria-hidden="true"></i> I have compiled aims to make this easier. Simply enter your grades and the spreadsheet will calculate your cumulative and semester GPA.
